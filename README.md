# Comparison of Machine Learning Techniques for Predicting Wind Power generation from weather data for Germany.

Code used in group project for Energy Data Analysis ESDA:

  germany_data_prep.py                  |    This code takes weather and wind power generation data, processes the data,
                                             merges the two sources and performs feature engineering.
  
  germany_pred_nn.py                    |    This code predicts wind generation using a neural network.                                          
                                             
  germany_2016_processed_data.csv       |    The resulting data after processing, with engineered features can be found here as a .csv file. 
                                             The original input data was too large to upload to GitHub, 
                                             but can be found at https://open-power-system-data.org/.
